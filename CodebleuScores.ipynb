      "4. **Iterate through columns:** The `for` loop iterates through columns 3 to 6 (which correspond to columns C to F in Excel).\n",
      "5. **Get values from rows 9 and 10:**  Inside the loop, it reads the values from rows 9 and 10 for the current column.\n",
      "6. **Calculate the average:** It calculates the average of the two values, handling cases where cells might be empty.\n",
      "7. **Write the average to row 11:** The calculated average is written to the corresponding cell in row 11.\n",
      "8. **Save the updated file:** Finally, the modified Excel file is saved with a new name (replace `'your_excel_file_updated.xlsx'` as needed).\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Import `openpyxl`:** This line imports the library needed for working with Excel files.\n",
    "2. **Load the workbook:** The code loads your Excel file (replace `'your_excel_file.xlsx'` with your actual file name).\n",
    "3. **Get the active sheet:**  It assumes you want to work with the active sheet in the workbook.\n",
    "4. **Iterate through columns:** The `for` loop iterates through columns 3 to 6 (which correspond to columns C to F in Excel).\n",
    "5. **Get values from rows 9 and 10:**  Inside the loop, it reads the values from rows 9 and 10 for the current column.\n",
    "6. **Calculate the average:** It calculates the average of the two values, handling cases where cells might be empty.\n",
    "7. **Write the average to row 11:** The calculated average is written to the corresponding cell in row 11.\n",
    "8. **Save the updated file:** Finally, the modified Excel file is saved with a new name (replace `'your_excel_file_updated.xlsx'` as needed).\n",

    "* **Direct Cell Manipulation (openpyxl):** Using `openpyxl` instead of pandas for direct cell manipulation. This is often more efficient for targeted changes like this, and importantly, it *avoids* formulas being written to the output file - the calculated average values are placed in the cells.\n",
